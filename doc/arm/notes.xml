  <section xml:id="root_key"><info><title>New DNSSEC Root Key</title></info>
    <para>
      ICANN is in the process of introducing a new Key Signing Key (KSK) for
      the global root zone. BIND has multiple methods for managing DNSSEC
      trust anchors, with somewhat different behaviors. If the root
      key is configured using the <command>managed-keys</command>
      statement, or if the pre-configured root key is enabled by using
      <command>dnssec-validation auto</command>, then BIND can keep
      keys up to date automatically. Servers configured in this way
      will roll seamlessly to the new key when it is published in
      the root zone. However, keys configured using the
      <command>trusted-keys</command> statement are not automatically
      maintained. If your server is performing DNSSEC validation
      and is configured using <command>trusted-keys</command>, you are
      advised to change your configuration before the root zone begins
      signing with the new KSK. This is currently scheduled for
      October 11, 2017.
    </para>
    <para>
      This release includes an updated version of the
      <filename>bind.keys</filename> file containing the new root
      key. This file can also be downloaded from

  <section xml:id="relnotes_license"><info><title>License Change</title></info>
    <para>
      With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open
      source license for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla
      Public License (MPL 2.0).
    </para>
    <para>
      The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to
      licensed software (e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside
      your organization, that you publish those changes under that
      same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you made to our software.
    </para>
    <para>
      This new requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND
      without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing it without
      changes, therefore this change will be without consequence
      for most individuals and organizations who are using BIND.
    </para>
    <para>
      Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their
      use of BIND, or who wish to discuss how to comply with the
      license may contact ISC at <link

	  Authoritative server support for the EDNS Client Subnet option
	  (ECS), introduced in BIND 9.11.0, was based on an early version
	  of the specification, and is now known to have incompatibilities
	  with other ECS implementations. It is also inefficient, requiring
	  a separate view for each answer, and is unable to correct for
	  overlapping subnets in the configuration.  It is intended for
	  testing purposes but is not recommended for for production use.
	  This was not made sufficiently clear in the documentation at
