Just a crude notes about the source handling (it needs cleanup).

- The source has been converted to git-buildpackage structure to allow
  easy team work

- uscan can be used to download new upstream sources

- d/copyright has been converted to machine readable format (TODO) and
  has Files-Excludes section for generation upstream tarball using
  mk-origtarball (via uscan) to remove contrib/ directory
